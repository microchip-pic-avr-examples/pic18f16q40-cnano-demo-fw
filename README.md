# PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity Nano Demonstration Firmware
The PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit is preprogrammed with this project to demonstrate some of the key features of the device family. This project highlights several of the main peripherals found on the PIC18F16Q40 such as the ADC with Computation (ADCC), the Temperature Indicator Module, Configurable Logic Cell (CLC), Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Module, 16-bit PWM, UART, and Timer 1/2 modules.

## Setup
A brand new PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity Nano comes with the code in this repository pre-programmed onto the device. This demo code can be reprogrammed to the PIC18F16Q40 by copying the hex file onto the CURIOSITY virtual drive that shows up once the Nano Board is plugged into a PC. The entire project can also be accessed using MPLABX 5.40 or newer.

## Operation
Upon start-up in this code example, the UART module is used to display an introduction message before moving into the main application loop. After the introduction has been displayed on the serial port, the ADCC is then used to periodically measure the device temperature using the Temperature Indicator Module. The device temperature in degrees Celsius will then be printed using the UART module very 500ms. At any time during operation the push button labeled SW0 on the Curiosity Nano can be used to toggle LED0. Any time SW0 is pressed, the state of LED0 will change and a message will be printed using the UART indicating that the button was pressed. Additionally, the PWM1 module is configured in this code example to drive pins RA4 and RA5 with complementary outputs.

### Device Temperature Measurment
In this code example the ADCC is used alongside the Temperature Indicator Module to measure the device temperature periodically. The ADCC was configured using MCC in basic mode with Timer1 as the auto-conversion trigger and the FVR as the ADC Positive Reference.   

In this configuration, both of the OPA inputs and the output is connected directly to the corresponding I/O pins. This allows the OPA to be used on its own with external discrete components to provide a feedback network and achieve a specific functionality.

| OPAMP | OPA1IN+       | OPA1IN-       | OUTPUT        |
| ----- | -------       | --------------| ------------- |
| OPA1  | RC3 (OPA1IN1+)| RA2 (OPA1IN2-)| RC2 (OPA1OUT) |

### SW0 Hardware Debouncing

In this configuration, the OPA is configured as a unity gain buffer (voltage follower). When configured in this mode, only positive input of the OPA (OPA1IN+) and the output (OPA1OUT) are connected to the external I/O pins, while the negative input of the OPA (OPA1IN-) is internally connected to the output of the OPA as shown in the figure below to form a unity gain buffer.

| OPA   | Positive Input  | Output (OUT)  |
| :----:|:--------------: | :-----------: |
| OPA1  |  RC3 (OPA1IN1+) | RC2 (OPA1OUT) |

### 16-bit PWM Demonstration

In this configuration, the OPA is configured as a non-inverting programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and uses the internal resistor ladder built into the OPA module. The positive input (OPA1IN+) and the output (OPA1OUT) of the OPA are connected to the corresponding I/O pins. The OPA is preconfigured with a gain of '4' using the internal resistor ladder. This gain can be changed by writing a different value to the GSEL bits of OPA1CON1 in the function named "void OPA_NonInverting(void)" located in "application.c".

| OPA    | Gain | Positive Input   | Output (OUT)  |
| :----: | :--: | :--------------: | :-----------: |
| OPA1   |  4   | RC3 (OPA1IN1+)   | RC2 (OPA1OUT) |
