# PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity Nano Demonstration Firmware
The PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit is preprogrammed with this project in order to demonstrate some of the key features of the device family. This project highlights several of the main peripherals found on the PIC18F16Q40 such as the ADC with Computation (ADCC), the Temperature Indicator Module, Configurable Logic Cell (CLC), Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Module, 16-bit PWM, UART, and Timer 1/2 modules.

## Setup
A brand new PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity Nano comes with the code in this repository pre-programmed onto the device. This demo code can be reprogrammed to the PIC18F16Q40 by copying the hex file onto the CURIOSITY virtual drive that shows up once the Nano Board is plugged into a PC. The entire project can also be accessed using MPLABX 5.40 or newer.

## Operation
Upon start-up in this code example, the UART module is used to display an introduction message before moving into the main application loop. After the introduction has been displayed on the serial port, the ADCC is then used to periodically measure the device temperature using the Temperature Indicator Module. The device temperature in degrees Celsius is printed using the UART module very 500ms. At any time during operation the push button labeled SW0 on the Curiosity Nano can be used to toggle LED0. Any time SW0 is pressed, the state of LED0 will change and a message will be printed via UART indicating that the button was pressed. Additionally, the PWM1 module is configured in this code example to drive pins RA4 and RA5.

### Using the ADCC and Temperature Indicator Modules to Measure Device Temperature
In this code example the ADCC is used alongside the Temperature Indicator Module to measure the device temperature periodically. The ADCC was configured using MCC in basic mode with Timer1 as the auto-conversion trigger (500ms period) and the FVR was selected as the ADC Positive Reference Voltage. In order to use the temperature indicator module the FVR Buffer 1 Gain was programmed to be 2.048V (2x), the TSEN bit was set to enable the Temperature Sensor, and the Temperature Sensor voltage range selected was the High-Range. The ADC Positive Channel (ADPCH) selected was the dedicated temperature indicator channel (channel_Temp). The following figure shows the ADCC configuration using MCC:

In order to calculate the device temperature in degrees Celsius using the raw ADC conversion result acquired, a compensation formula which is described in the device datasheet is required. The formula uses the raw ADC conversion result, along with a few parameters that are available in the DIA table and accessible by reading the specified areas in flash. The code snippet below shows the routine used in this demonstration to calculate the device temperature in degrees Celsius using the raw ADC conversion result. The Memory module in MCC was added to this project to generate the APIs that were used to read the temperature indicator parameters from the DIA table. Please refer to the device datasheet for more information.

```c
void TempIndicator_Calc(void) {
    gain = FLASH_ReadWord(DIA_TSHR1);
    offset = FLASH_ReadWord(DIA_TSHR3);
    adcc_meas = ADCC_GetConversionResult();
    tempC = (int24_t) adcc_meas * gain;
    tempC = tempC / 256;
    tempC = tempC + offset;
    tempC = tempC / 10;
    printf("Temp Sensor Result %d \r\n", tempC);
}
```
### 16-bit PWM Demonstration
The 16-bit PWM was configured in this code example to generate an output frequency of 100 kHz with a Duty Cycle of 25% using MCC. The 16-bit PWM allows for dual outputs, and the polarity of each output can be controlled as well. The PWM1 Output 1 was programmed to be on pin RA4 and PWM Output 2 is located on pin RA5. The PWM outputs on both of these pins are identical, with the exception that output 2 on RA5 is inverted. The 16-bit PWM module is a core independent peripheral, and pins RA4 and RA5 are continually driven in this code example without any CPU utilization. The following figures show the PWM configuration in this code example using MCC, and the resulting output waveforms on pins RA4 and RA5.

### Core Independent Hardware Debouncer

In this configuration, the OPA is configured as a unity gain buffer (voltage follower). When configured in this mode, only positive input of the OPA (OPA1IN+) and the output (OPA1OUT) are connected to the external I/O pins, while the negative input of the OPA (OPA1IN-) is internally connected to the output of the OPA as shown in the figure below to form a unity gain buffer.

| OPA   | Positive Input  | Output (OUT)  |
| :----:|:--------------: | :-----------: |
| OPA1  |  RC3 (OPA1IN1+) | RC2 (OPA1OUT) |

In this configuration, the OPA is configured as a non-inverting programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and uses the internal resistor ladder built into the OPA module. The positive input (OPA1IN+) and the output (OPA1OUT) of the OPA are connected to the corresponding I/O pins. The OPA is preconfigured with a gain of '4' using the internal resistor ladder. This gain can be changed by writing a different value to the GSEL bits of OPA1CON1 in the function named "void OPA_NonInverting(void)" located in "application.c".

| OPA    | Gain | Positive Input   | Output (OUT)  |
| :----: | :--: | :--------------: | :-----------: |
| OPA1   |  4   | RC3 (OPA1IN1+)   | RC2 (OPA1OUT) |
